A first-person puzzle game in space.

The game starts with the main character crashing on another planet. The player takes on the role of a deep-sea fish species that finds itself alone and lost on this planet without memory of how they got there and must explore the planet, collecting missing tapes by solving puzzles. As they explore, they will gradually uncover the truth behind the planet and escape it.
